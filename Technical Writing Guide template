#Introduction

#About this guide

The Cyrus One Technical Writing Style Guide provides guidelines to maintain a consistent style, voice, and tone across the company’s documentation.  A consistent tone and style make your content easier to read. This guide is intended to be used as a supplement to the [Microsoft Style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), which is the primary source of guidance for Cyrus One product documentation.


##How to use this guide

This style guide encodes the style used by Cyrus One documentation for developers; it does not claim to be objectively better than other style guides. The rules in this guide are not meant to be absolute. You should have readable documentation, first and foremost; if the result is not readable, you should exercise your own judgement. 

For a quick set of technical writing guidelines see [Microsoft's top 10 tipos for style and voice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice).

 
#Style guidelines

##Voice and tone

The documentation should use a friendly, conversational voice. Be respectful and approachable. In general, address the reader of your documents using the second person instead of the first person: use you or your instead of we, our, or us. Assume that the reader is the person who's doing the tasks that you're documenting. Use the word user only to refer to the user of the software that your reader is developing. 

* Present the key information first; put it in the most noticeable spot. Lead with what's most importatnt.

* Talk like a person. Write colloquially, without being cutesy. Read your text aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would say? Don’t use jargon and acronyms when explaining things. 

* Keep it simple. Use bigger ideas, fewer words. Write short sentences that are easy to scan and read. Break up explanations, and layer the information so that people can stop once they found out what they need.

* Know what your users do, what their goals are, and why they perform these actions. Minimize how much content customers must wade through to get to something they recognize as real work.

## Some things to avoid

Buzzwords and jargon
- Ableist language
- Long-winded sentences
- Obscure implementation details
- Internet slang

# Writing inclusively

## Audience

Cyrus One customers live and work all over the world. Write for a globlal audience. It's usually safe to assume your content will be read in many countries and by readers whose primary language isn't English. Some content will probably be translated into other languages or localized. Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references.

Voice is either active or passive. Keep it active whenever you can.

* In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action.
* In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action

## Gender identity and pronouns

Don't use gendered pronouns in generic references. In particular, do not use he, him, she, or her as gender-neutral pronouns, and do not use he/she, (s)he, or he or she or other similar compound approaches. Instead, use the singular “they”.

Always use the second-person pronoun wherever possible.

For relative pronouns, always make use of that, which, and who to clarify the sentence structure.

# Formatting

## Dates and times

When expressing times use the 12-hour clock, except in cases where the 24-hour clock is required:

- Use exact times, in the HH:MM format

- Always capitalize AM and PM

- Remove the minutes for round hours

For ranges, use hyphens without spaces, for instance: 5-10 minutes ago.

Not all time zones have names, and some time-zone names are used in more than one geographical area. If you're talking about a particular place, clarify the country or reference Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Don't include spaces around the plus sign (+) or hyphen (-).

Examples:
- Eastern Time (UTC-5)
- Eastern Time (UTC+10)
- Eastern Time (Australia)

When expressing dates:

Use the name of months and days of the week in full, with the month followed by the day of the month, a comma, and the full four-digits year. For numeric only dates, use the YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Numbers

- When using ordinal numbers, spell them out in text: first, second, tenth, twenty-first.

- Spell out numbers between zero and nine.

- Spell out numbers at the beginning of a sentence.

- Use numerals for negative numbers, fractions, percentages, dimensions, and decimals.

## Capitalization

* Use title-style capitalization only for top level titles, and sentence-style capitalization for everything else:
  * Capitalize the first word of a sentence.
  * Use lowercase for every other word.
  * When words are joined by a slash, capitalize the second word if the first is also capitalized.

* Never use all uppercase for emphasis.

* Do not use all lowercase as a style choice.

* Do not use internal capitalization, unless it’s a brand name.

* Do not capitalize a spelled-out acronym, unless it’s a brand name or a proper noun.

# Graphical interfaces

## Text entry

To indicate that a user should input text, use "enter" as opposed to "type" or "input". The text to enter should be in monospace.

## Screenshots

Avoid screenshots for both accessibility and localization reasons. If you must use screenshots, use them as judiciously as possible and ensure alt text is unique and descriptive.  

Use text equivalents for every diagram, image, or other non-text element. Avoid using images of text instead of actual text.

## User interface elements

Use bold text for all graphical user interface (GUI) element names, including menus, menu items, buttons, dialog boxes, and windows. Use bold text for the element name if the name appears in the GUI, even if the element is not clickable.

In writing for customers, use regular type to describe type that's neither bold nor italic. Don't use italics or italicized.


# Links

## Cross-references and external

Follow these guidelines when adding cross-references within your documentation:

* Include cross-references only when necessary.

* If the information is critical, consider including it instead of cross-referencing.

* Avoid unnecessary links to external sites.

* When possible, link to a top-level page and avoid deep links to a specific page or image.

* Do not use bare URLs for links. Bare URLs are unhelpful because they do not provide adequate context about the link target.

* All link URLs and cross-reference links must provide descriptive text that conveys information about the content of the target linked page prior to clicking the link. Do not use a generic phrase like “click here”. 


# Legal

## Cost references

Avoid all references to the costs and charges of Cyrus One products.  Any cost information is best referenced in marketing materials.

## Future releases or plans

When possible, avoid making statements that predict future releases or plans.

However, some circumstances, such as release notes or deprecation notices, might dictate that you refer to a future release, plan, or event. In these situations, follow these guidelines:

* When discussing future plans, use words such as "anticipate", "expect", or "plan".

* Do not promise that a feature or a fix for a known issue will be included in an upcoming release or according to a specific timeline.

* Do not refer to a specific future release. For example, do not mention a particular release number or a specific release date.
